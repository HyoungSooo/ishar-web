<h1>Help on: area zoo at barcas</h1>
<pre>
                    History of the Zoo at Barcas</pre>
<pre>    Once Barcas had established its reputation for power and 
wealth, the nobility -- in a rather out-of-character and generous
move -- decided to offer up something for all citizens to enjoy.
The Zoo at Barcas was opened as a way to show off the island's
wealth and extravagance, while tossing crumbs to the city's poor by
charging no admission.  The plan worked.  Crowds flocked to the zoo
-- especially to see its showpiece draj, Annabelle.  The city makes
a fortune on the concession-stand prices and the citizens of Barcas
hail its leaders for their goodwill.</pre>
<pre>    The zoo's inhabitants range from small, lovable critters to 
rather large beasts into whose cages you dare not stick your hand.
That said, the Zoo at Barcas is a rather lovely place to spend a
day eating snacks with the kiddies.</pre>
