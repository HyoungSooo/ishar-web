<h1>Help on: area orcan clans</h1>

<p>
   Stay and harken to the origin of Orcs, cousins to the cruel goblins, and
their tireless war, which even the elves were eventually drawn into.

<p>   The history of the Daelon and the spawning of the goblins, gnomes and
hobbits is a long tale of great adventure and misfortune, which I will not
now recount. Suffice to say that all three races are akin and yet distant, but
while the hobbits and gnomes coexist peacefully they are bitter enemies with
the goblins. Finding no rest or succor in the forest that spawned them, the 
cruel goblins sought long for a home. 

<p>   After a time the wandering goblins found there way to the great pinewoods
that cover the foothills of the northern mountains and stretch west, almost
all the way to the great sea. The currently uninhabited wood felt almost
familiar, especially further southwest when the pines began to give way to
great redwoods and oaks, and they halted. However it was not long before the
malicious nature they inherited from their forefath, Urgurr, began to show its
teeth and the goblins fractured into clans and turned upon eachother.

<p>   One clan saw the mountains and desired its strength. They venerated the
great winged eagles that made their eyries high in the peaks and worshipped the
ferocious cold and terrific storms and sought to harness their power. They 
made their strong place upon the cliffs that overshadowed the great forest and
over time, adapted. Thick brown fur grew to withstand the cold and they grew
powerful in both build and magic as they studied and learned from their new
home.

<p>   Another clan retreated deeper into the forest, away from the looming and
hostile mountains and into the more familiar and life filled country of the
great deciduous trees. There they met and befriended the wolves and learned
from them the arts of stalking and hunting, of working as a pack to destroy 
ones foes and grow strong. The orcs of this clan greatly revered the proud
predators and took as their own the mighty Wolf God, Maugrim. Over the years
they grew somewhat like to their adopted brethen; their limbs lengthening, 
their bodies growing wiry and lean and their eyes turning golden and reflecting
light. 

<p>   The last and final clan was forced to flee far to the west; unable to turn
east to the hostile elves, gnomes and hobbits, north to mighty mountain clan or
south to the vicious forest clan. Eventually they found a home at the base of
the river Telemacus. They remained much the same as their ancestors and enter 
no more into this tale.

<p>   It is the first two clans; the sorcerous goblins of the mountain tribe and
the prowlers of the forests who remained and still remain to this day, locked
ever in a ceaseless war. Over the years they earned a new name, Orcs. It is 
thought that this name comes from a perversion of the ancient name of Urgurr,
whom the hobbits of Ingeen still remember and curse.

<p>   Thus ends the telling of the history of the Orc clans. However, it is a 
history that is still being written and I must now speak of the Elvish
migration and what part it plays.
<pre>    Most know of the history of Elves and the great conflict to the east and
that some elves fled west to escape it. The main group, whom would eventually
found the colony within the forests of Evermore, traveled west through the very
forests of which we have already told. As you can imagine, both orcan clans
were quick to respond with aggression to intruders upon their land and harried
the elven caravan all throughout the forest of Jharet. Finally finding refuge
in Evermore, the elves rested and built their home, but they never forgot the
loss of friends and family along the trail.</pre>

<p>   Eventually the elves of Evermore grew strong and sought to secure the route
through the forest to their eastern kindred and seek revenge upon the orcs. A
large force set forth on a quick and brutal campaign. The orcs fled before 
them, unable the stand before the surprise assault and the elves were able to 
establish a stronghold upon on of the tall foothills near the edge of the orcs
territory.

<p>   Before long, hostilities redoubled and there was almost a semblance of peace
between the estranged clans as they sought to drive out the invaders. Finally,
one night, they succeeded. Raiding in the cold hours just before dawn, the 
wolf clan surrounded the entirety of the hill and set fire to the trees. The
billowing smoke forced the elves, bleary and disoriented, out into the waiting
jaws of the raiders. Only a small number came stumbling back to Evermore. The
tower was ravaged and broken and the orcs returned back to their war on 
eachother. 

<p>   It is rumored, however, that elves still seek revenge and even now a small
advance force has crept back into Jharet.

<p>NOTES:
   Recommended Levels: 13-18
   Group Size: 2-5

<p>   Search within the great Jharet Forest if you seek to find the orcs. Be wary,
   however, they have lost none of their malicious nature and the ancient 
   forest has dangers of their own. A wise adventurer would be prepared for all
   situations before seeking a conflict with either clan.
