<h1>Help on: alignment</h1>

<p>   A character's alignment is the measure of how good or evil that character
is.  Alignment varies over:

<p>Very Evil - Evil - Slightly Evil - Neutral - Slightly Good - Good - Very Good

<p>   Alignment normally varies over time, depending on the alignment of the 
creatures you kill.  Once you venture past the Slight/Neutral alignments and
become Good or Evil, it is somewhat difficult to become Neutral again.
There are items that may help your transition in either direction.

<p>   Some articles of equipment are anathema to your specific alignment and
cannot be used by you.  It could be of crucial importance to a player though
if suddenly a piece of equipment becomes unwearable at a bad time.

<p>   Clerics have a spell to see alignment, and some objects bestow that
ability on the wearer.
