Excerpt from "The Dwarven Anthology" --

<p>   In the months following the defeat of the dwarves at the hands of the
Mareldjans, religious speculation begin to cause unprecedented unrest among
the people.  Questions arose as to why the gods allowed the dwarves to
lose the war, and as to whether the gods existed at all.  The troubled 
dwarves began forming into bands centered around varying priests, each 
with a different explanation for the misfortune that had befallen them in 
the war.  The bands fiercely defended their newfound beliefs, and the 
caverns erupted in violence as fanatics hunted down opposing religious 
leaders with reckless abandon.  In vain did the governing council 
attempt to reunite the commoners, and soon a great schism occurred.  

<p>   The diverse sects packed their few belongings and turned their backs 
on their former home, seeking instead to create individual settlements 
where there would be no voices to refute their beliefs.  Most of these 
sects died in the mountains from a simple lack of population, but three 
of the least vehement groups managed to carve out a home for themselves: 
the Ramluf, the Vanari, and the Muradians.

<p>   Life for the exiles was difficult, and there was a constant need for
more resources, especially water.  Each sect discovered an underground
river in time, and sent a few small parties to seek out the source of the
water in hopes of finding a suitable location for a city.

<p>   A party from the Muradian sect soon discovered the source to be an
enormous lake, which they named after their leader, Cadain.  They sent a
few of their number to report their findings to their village, and then
set up a small camp for the night.  Certain that this would be their new
home, they began to explore their surroundings in earnest the next day.
After a few days of wandering about, they happened upon a Ramluf camp
which had already started the groundwork for a great city on the lake's
shore.  Surprised at this development, both camps sent out additional
scouts and soon discovered similar parties composed of Vanari which 
shared their intention to build a new city.

<p>   The leaders of the three sects met and agreed to combine their efforts
and create an unparalleled city to surround the magnificent lake, where
religious freedom would be assured and all dwarves could live in harmony.

<p>   Construction of the city would span centuries, such was the 
monumental effort required to excavate an area large enough to contain 
the whole of their populations.  A few names were proposed at various 
stages, but the citizens took to calling it simply "Cadain," after the 
lake which had offered them salvation.

<p>   The three sects remained somewhat segregated, their previous class 
divisions being too strong to dismiss.  The relatively poor Vanari lived 
in quiet contentment in the western parts of the city, leading uneventful 
lives but happy with their lot in life.  The Muradians, being composed 
almost strictly of merchants, settled in the northern areas and began 
mining the caverns for precious stones that they might trade with 
travelers from the surface.  The Ramluf were former aristocrats, and 
chose to live in opulent splendor in the eastern area.

<p>   Cadain had lived in relative peace since its founding, but now finds 
itself engaged in a war of attrition against the xymara, a reptilian race 
bent on destruction without cause.  The xymaran numbers seem endless, and 
the morale of the dwarven army is rapidly worsening.

<p>NOTES:
  Recommended Levels: any
  Group Size: any

<p>  The city of Cadain offers something for everyone, and is an ideal place
  to gain early levels in.  You may want to investigate the dwarves' 
  xymaran problem, but be aware that as of yet there is no reward for 
  resolving their difficulties.
