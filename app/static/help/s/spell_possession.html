<p>   By tearing a possessing entity from the netherworld, and bending it to 
his will, a necromancer of sufficient power can force the spirit to enter 
into a non-magical, non-enchanted weapon or piece of armor of his choosing. 
Though the ritual destroys much of the spirit's free will, its controlling
nature provides great benefit to the wielder.  The weapon will be more swift
and higher casters will find their weapons more deadly than before.  Armor,
while not physically improved, certainly will help protect against more
subtle attacks.
   Unfortunately these vestiges of sentience also make themselves known
in more pointed ways from time to time.  Some elderly, and perhaps senile,
warriors have been seen carrying on a one-sided conversation with no one.

<p>   Some necromancers may be willing to sell you the service of binding
spirits, for the right price.

<p>Spell Potency Bonuses:

<p>   Necromancers who have opted for Spell Potency of at least the second
tier will be able to bend even more powerful spirits to their will and 
bind them to certain items.  These great shades hunger constantly for 
power, and may help the wielder to whom they are bound.  Beware, 
however, most items will crumble to dust from the strain of containing
them.
