<h1>Help on: quitting</h1>

<p>
Have you been playing this game for years and don't find it fun any more?
Do you yearn for the excitement of "how the game used to be", back when you
still had something to learn about the game?  Do you find that your
performance at work or your grades in school are suffering, you are spending
little or no time enjoying the company of real-life humans, and you have
nothing to show for it except a nice kit and knowledge of how to kill
obscure monsters?  Have you tried to quit, but found that you couldn't stay
away for more than a few hours or days?

<p>You might be suffering from MUD addiction, a serious problem that affects
veteran players.  We can help you quit the habit and regain a life; just
talk to any visible Eternal or higher.
