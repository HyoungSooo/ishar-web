<h1>Help on: guilds</h1>

<p>   In order to make use of a skill, you must first practice it.  This is
most often done in a guild, several of which are found in the town of
Mareljda. Others exist in other cities, and there are individuals in the
lands who have mastered certain unique skills and teach them as well.

<p>   While most guilds are open to all players of a specific class, there are
special ones which teach only to certain alignments, races, players who have
solved quests, or possess special items.

<p>   When you find your guildmaster, type "practice" to get a list of what
skills they may be able to teach you.
