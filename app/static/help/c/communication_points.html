<h1>Help on: communication points</h1>

<p>
To prevent people from being spammy to everyone in the game, points are used
for some forms of communication.  They are regained slowly over
approximately 3 hours.

<p>Say, address, whisper, gtell, socials, and yell are never limited and never
take any communication points.  Tell, ask, and reply are always free to
people in your group, people in the same room as you, and people who have
used tell, ask, or reply to you in the last mud day.

<p>All other forms of communication take points per person that sees your
message.  Repeatedly telling to someone who hasn't responded to you recently
will quickly take away your voice.  And shout will be most expensive as
most mortals can hear you.

<p>The first few hours that you are in the game with a new character, you might
run into the limits.  You hopefully won't normally.
