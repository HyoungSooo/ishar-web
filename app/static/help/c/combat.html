<h1>Help on: combat</h1>

<p>   Skill in combat is something that can only be gained by experience.  Still,
there are a few things a new player can do to improve his chances of survival.
<pre>      1. Make sure wimpy mode is ON.  A player with wimpy mode turned
         on automatically flees when he gets below 20% of his 
         maximum health.  This is especially important for new players
         since low-level characters don't have that much health to 
         start with.</pre>
<pre>      2. Use the display command and set your prompt to show your
         current health.  Keep an eye on your prompt and flee if
         your health gets too low.</pre>
<pre>      3. Use the 'consider' command and be SURE the opponent you
         choose is appropriate to your level.  Nothing gets you killed
         quicker than biting off more than you can chew.</pre>
<pre>      4. MUDding is a social game.  You will have more fun and have more
         success if you group with other players of similar level.  If
         possible, find a group with experienced players to show you
         the ropes.</pre>

<p>   MUD combat can be a little difficult to follow at first.  As you get more
experienced, your eye will become trained to scan the text and extract the
important information.  If your communications software includes a scroll-back
buffer, I recommend you review your first few fights and notice the common
patterns of the exchanges.
