<h1>MUD Clients</h1>
While you can certainly enjoy the game via <a href="/connect/">our web client</a> (<strong>coming soon!</strong>),
you might prefer to connect to the game with software designed specifically to help you play a MUD.
<p>
Here are some of the MUD clients that we have heard good things about:
<p>
{% for platform in mud_clients %}
<h2>{{ platform }}</h2>
{% for name, link in mud_clients[platform].items() %}
<ul><a href="{{ link }}" target="_blank" rel="noopener">{{ name }}</a></ul>
{% endfor %}
{% endfor %}
<p>
After you download one, tell it to connect to <strong>isharmud.com</strong> on port <strong>23</strong> or <strong>9999</strong>
to connect to the game, then see our <a href="/help/m/mud_basics.html">getting started guide</a> for tips on how to play.
<p>
Everything listed here can be used at no cost. Do not be afraid to try a few, as they all have different strengths and weaknesses.
