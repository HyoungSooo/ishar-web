                <h1>MUD Clients</h1>
                While you can certainly enjoy the game via <a href="{{ url_for('connect') }}" target="_blank">the Mudslinger web client</a>,
                you might prefer to connect to the game with software designed specifically to help you play a MUD.
                <p>Here are some of the MUD clients that we have heard good things about:</p>
                {%- for platform in mud_clients %}
                <h2>{{ platform }}</h2>
                <ul>
                {%- for name, link in mud_clients[platform].items() %}
                    <li><a href="{{ link }}" target="_blank" rel="noopener">{{ name }}</a></li>
                {%- endfor %}
                </ul>
                {%- endfor %}
                <p>After you download one, tell it to connect to <strong>isharmud.com</strong> on port <strong>23</strong> or <strong>9999</strong>
                to connect to the game, then see our <a href="/help/m/mud_basics.html">getting started guide</a> for tips on how to play.</p>
                <p>Everything listed here can be used at no cost. Do not be afraid to try a few, as they all have different strengths and weaknesses.</p>
