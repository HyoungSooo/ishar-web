                Ishar is an online text-adventure RPG (commonly called a MUD) set in a
                large, unique world of fantasy and magic.  Players do battle with fearsome
                foes (and sometimes each other) to win great wealth and wrest rare prizes
                from the treasure hoards or bloody corpses of their enemies.
