## About

Ishar is an online text-adventure RPG _(commonly called a multi-user dungeon,
or MUD)_ set in a large, unique world of fantasy and magic.

Players do battle with fearsome foes _(and sometimes each other)_ to win
great wealth and wrest rare prizes from the treasure hoards or bloody corpses
of their enemies.
